This project aimed to "emulate" cave story in a 3D environment, but over time drifted more and more away from it.
Now it is more of a general purpose engine for any 3D tiled platforming game, with all the things you need like:

* A free moving camera
* An online multiplayer
* Different sprites for characters
* NPC support
* Guns
* GUUUUUUUUNS
* An easy method to add/remove weapons
* Tile map support using the free "[tiled map editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/)"

Development is slowly "progressing", with sometimes breaks which can last for over half a year.
To get updates, make sure to visit the official forum post on the cave story wiki:

## Todo

* use [BufferGeometryUtils.mergeVertices](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/utils/BufferGeometryUtils.mergeVertices) for hopefully dramatic speed improvements
  * this might require updating three.js?
